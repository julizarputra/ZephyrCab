The crunch object

The crunch object is actually a very simple way to handle things. I built this in to allow for easy addition of calculations without cluttering up code.

This function is rather involved, but simple to use. It is for calculating the tractive effort of a diesel locomotive at a given speed.

It is called like so:

crunch.tractiveEffort(horsepower, speed, efficiency, beginningSpeed, startingTE)

Arguments:
horsepower - the OUTPUT HORSEPOWER of the locomotive. This is dependent on the notch.
speed - the current speed of the locomotive IN MILES PER HOUR. IF YOU GIVE IT KM/HR IT WILL BE WRONG!
efficiency - the efficiency of the locomotive in converting power into torque, expressed as a decimal. For example, 75% efficiency would be 0.75
startingTE - the starting tractive effort in lbs
beginningSpeed - the speed to start using the equation to find TE. Until this speed, the function will simply report the starting TE.

The function will return a tractive effort value in POUNDS.

This function is built using an equation outlined in an engineering paper by Virginia Tech.
